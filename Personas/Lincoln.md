**Job**: Currently retired but through his working years as a builder then went into politics for a bit becoming mayor of Rotorua in 2002 when he was 52 and got re-elected in 2005 finishing as major when he was 58 then went and did odd contractor jobs till he was 67 when he fully retired. 

**Behavior**: Precise, every detail needs to be perfect. When he has an image or an idea about how something should be, he has to see it right to the end. 

**Hobbies**: Every so often will grab a piece of wood and make something out of it, either from being bored or for relatives' birthdays. Previous work in politics likes to read up on where the partys views are at.

**Computing Experience**: Like most people his age thinks that computers are magic especially mobile phones that you can now talk to, to do stuff for you.  Quite often will call up the grandkids to help do stuff on computers and the internet. Can click a mouse on stuff.

**Political Interested**: Very interested in politics and has been for many years especially since running and after being major in Rotorua for 6 years.

**Political Views**: Has strong political views but still believes that the system is defiantly flawed. Thinks it good to have a political system even if it is flawed and not just one party will fit for a person.

**Thoughts on voting**: Has the opinion that with something like general elections people vote for the big parties because they have always been the front runners and other groups just don't have a chance. Due to getting older and, most parties have their full policies online finding it harder to work out if he should change his party alignment or stay with the normal one, he would vote for even if a few policies no longer line up for him.

**Goals**:
- To get younger ones interested in the political system and make them feel like they have a voice.
- Made sure that the younger generation feels loved and have a country that works with and for them.

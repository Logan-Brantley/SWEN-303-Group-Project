Isabelle is a 19 year old Chemistry student at Victoria University of Wellington. After living in a Hall last year,
this is the first year that she is living in a flat with four other students. Being in her second year of her degree
she is extremely busy and has a lot of assignments and material to learn. This means that she doesn’t have a lot of
time to spare and often doesn’t watch or read the news. Her goal using the Political Compass is to understand how her
views line up to the Political Parties. This would help her learn who to vote for. Since she is busy with University, 
she doesn’t have a lot of time to spend so she would want it to be easy and fast to complete. She also wants the results
from her survey answers to be easy to read and understand as she doesn’t usually follow politics.


**Activities:** Isabelle spends most of her time at University. Between lectures, labs and study she is very busy. With her 
limited spare time she is learning to cook as she has never had to cook for herself before.

**Attitudes:** Isabelle is very stubborn and she is very stuck in her views. She is always extremely organised and plans 
out her time and her schedule for every day.

**Aptitudes:** Isabelle is extremely academically intelligent and picks up her course material fairly quickly. Her brain is 
usually full of Chemistry notes and formulas that she is trying to memorise for tests and exams.


**Weaknesses:** She lacks some common sense at times and can struggle to see other people’s point of views on topics. It is
often her way or the highway.

**Domain Knowledge:** This is not something that Isabelle has used before. It is the first time that she is able to vote so it
isn’t something she has ever been curious about using before.

**System Knowledge:** This is not something that Isabelle has used before and a little out of her comfort zone.

**Interaction:** Isabelle only wants to interact with this system once. She wants to be able to complete a survey with her views,
get the results and then be able to finish with the system.

**Priorities:** Isabella wants to be certain of the political party that lines up with her views. She wants to know that she is going
to be voting for the right person. She wants it to be an easy and quick process so it doesn’t consume much of her time.

**Motivations:** Isabelle is using the Political compass to understand her views and what party lines up with her view so that she can
vote for the party that best suits her views. She wants to be able to be educated when she votes.

**Computer Self-efficacy:** Isabelle is confident using a computer, generally, but does get a little worried when it is something new that
she hasn’t done before. She often doesn’t read instructions, if there are such things, and this means that she can get a little lost and confused.

**Risk Tolerance:** Isabelle has low risk tolerance. She prefers to use technologies that she has used before and doesn’t like to step out of her
comfort zone too much or too often. This means that she tends to stick to what she knows and what she can do.

**Information Processing:** Isabelle has a lot of information in her head already with the material that she is learning for her Chemistry degree.
This means that she doesn’t like to absorb too much more information that isn’t related to her studies.

**Tinkering:** Isabelle likes to stick to what she knows. She doesn’t tend to experiment much and stick to what she knows. She is only willing 
to learn something new if she thinks that she can get something out of it.

**Political view:** Due to not having much interest in politics Isabelle doesn't have many political views. Her family never discussed politics 
and she doesn't hold any religious beliefs that affect her decision making on major political points  such as abortion. Note that thought being 
in the center politically speaking she does have slightly more left learning view and because of this would more likely be a Labor supporter.

<br>William is a 50 year old doctor. He lives in an apartment in central Wellington with his wife. He works at Wellington Regional Hospital. He uses the political compass application to check whether the party he intends to vote for still aligns with his beliefs and ideology. He is voting to share his opinion as a citizen in what he thinks is best for New Zealand going forward. While utilising the application, he wants to be able to take the political compass quiz relatively quickly, but also be given the time needed to think through his answers. At work, he has to utilise software that has poor interfaces, so he would like the application to have a simple and intuitive interface to interact with.

**Activities**: He spends most of his free time keeping up with current events and spending time with his wife.

**Attitudes**: He is very conscious of respecting other people's choices and wishes. However, he can become frustrated when complex ideas are simplified too much.

**Aptitudes**: As a doctor, he has learned to work under extreme pressure and gained problem solving skills.

**Weaknesses**: He can often overwork himself, resulting in stress and tiredness.

**Domain Knowledge**: He has voted in numerous previous elections.

**System Knowledge**: He has utilised a simple political compass in the past. However, he did not find it very useful due to its clunky interface.

**Interaction**: He will interact with the compass application before each election.

**Priorities**: He wants to be able to take the quiz relatively quickly (in under 15 minutes) and he wants the interface to be intuitive.

**Motivation**: He will utilise the application to check that the party he intends to vote for still aligns with his own beliefs.

**Computer Self-efficacy**: He is confident in most tasks, but could still become stuck if something went wrong.

**Risk Tolerance**: He has a medium risk tolerance, as he is willing to try a new application such as the political compass quiz. However, if his experience is negative, he is unlikely to do so again without hearing about improvements to the application from other people he knows.

**Information Processing**: He absorbs decent amounts of information quickly.

**Tinkering**: He likes to try new software applications, given that they are relevant to his interests.

![alt text](Karen.png "Karen")
<br>Karen is a 42 year old teacher. She lives in a 2 bedroom house in Johnsonville with her husband and two children, Marta (12) and Jay (10). She teaches Year 9 and 10 Maths at Wellington College. She uses the political compass to figure out which party she should vote for this year. She will be voting for strong, wise leadership of government so that her children and students might be given the best New Zealand possible once they are adults. However, she is not completely sure which party aligns with her best. While using the software, she wants to be able to take the quiz quickly without worrying about the interface or process, as she will likely have a small amount of time to take the quiz around work and family life.

Feedback:
- He thought log-in was for users, not admins
- He would expect that site asks if user would like to save progress if leaving site mid-quiz
- Info pages could have a side-bar-esque method of navigating parties while viewing policies
- Test results should have labels and percentages for graph
- Admin stats graphs should be labelled as well
- He asked where to log out on admin page
- He said that its good that results page has buttons to take you to different party info pages
- He said tab bar at top is good - can access all pages from anywhere
- He suggested: on home page, right hand of the screen, have buttons to take you to party policies with title "See the parties"



NOTES:
- Viewing previous results didnt work?

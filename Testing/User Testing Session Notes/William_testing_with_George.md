# Prototype Testing: George

Taking the Test:
- 19.4 seconds
- No miss clicks, but he selected the 'test' tab instead of the 'start' button
on the homepage.

About page:
- 2.52 seconds
- 1 click

View Parties and Party Policy:
- 7.33 seconds
- 1 click

Feedback:
 - The only way to view your previous results from the home page is to take the
test again.
 - Suggested drop down for previous results under the test menu bar.
 - Likes minimal colourscheme, layout.
 - Could not initially tell "Info" was about Party info, not test info. He
 suggests renaming it to Party Info, and having site info either on a new tab
 or under About Us.

Admin:
- 12.1 seconds
- 1 click

Feedback:
 - Unsure about what the Admin side would be for.
 - Thought the login was for users, suggested renaming to Admin Login or not
 making it visible on main site.

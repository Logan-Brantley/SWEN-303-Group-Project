# Party Info

The Party Information page provides the user information about a single Political Party. It provides the user general information about the Party, as well as a link to a list of all the policies of that party. This means that it provides more information to the user about a party. This would be a useful page for a user to look at after completing the survey. Once they had their results they would be able to find out more information about each of the parties, beyond just knowing which one aligns with their views the most. Like all the other pages, it's design is consistent with the other pages.

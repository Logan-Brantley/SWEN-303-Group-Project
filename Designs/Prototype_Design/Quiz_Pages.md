# Survey

This page is the Political Compass survey. This is the main function of the site and it's main purpose. It is a long list of questions that the user has to answer. All of the questions have options underneath the question so that the user can select how strongly they care about that question, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. This means that the user can show how strongly they care about an issue as well as what side they stand on that issue. By having buttons, it also makes it easier for the user to express where they stand without having to find the words to do so. Once the user has selected an answer for all of the questions, they are able to submit and then find out their results. As stated previously, this page has consistent design with the other pages on the site, for consistency for the user.

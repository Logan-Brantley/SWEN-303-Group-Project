# Statistics

This page provides the administrators with some statistic information about the site. This provides the administrators with some data about how well the site is functioning as well as some information about the users that are using the site. Since this page is providing administrative information, it is only available to the administrators. This means that they have to have logged in to their administrator account before being able to access this page. Even though it is just for administrators, it is still important that the design of this page is still consistent with the other pages on the site.

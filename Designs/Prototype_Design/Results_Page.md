# Results

This page provides the user with their survey results. It takes the answers that the user has selected when completing the survey, and calculated the results from those answers. It then provides the user with the results, in a format that is simple for the user to understand. It means that the user can understand which Political Party their views align with and can give them an indication of who they should vote for. Since this is the main function of the site, it is important that this page is clear and simple for someone to understand, even someone with less political knowledge. Like the other pages, this page has consistent design so that the site is consistent across pages.

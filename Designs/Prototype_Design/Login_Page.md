# Log In

This is the Log in page for the Political Compass Site. It is used for the administrators of the site so that they can log into their accounts, and view information that is not available to the general user.  It is still consistent with the other pages across the site, even if it is just for the administrators for the site, who are likely to be more familiar with the site. Beyond the navigation bar at the top, all this page allows the user to do is log into an administrator account. There are no accounts for the general user of the site so they donâ€™t need to be able to log in.

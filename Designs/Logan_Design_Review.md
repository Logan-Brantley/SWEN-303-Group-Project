# Logan's Design Review
[Logan's A2 Designs](Designs/Logan_A2_Designs/Logan_A2_Designs.md)<br>

Minimalism:
- Easily readable design with large font.
- Simple and clean.
- Voting pages could be cluttered on small screens.
- Confirmation button on page to confirm ballot is finished could simply read *Confirm*.

Control:
- Has a useful option to translate to Te Reo Maori.
- Allows more user choice from entry to system.
- Useful confirmation page in case user makes mistake.
- Web access for admin allows for better control and ease of access.

Help:
- Could have more info for new voters (i.e. term *spoil ballot*)
- Good explanation of each vote type for users.

Consistency:
- Same colours used throughout system.

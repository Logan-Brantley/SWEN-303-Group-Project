# Fabian's Design Review
[Fabian's A2 Designs](Designs/Fabian_A2_Designs)<br>

Language:
- Great use of commonly used terms for majority of project.
- Standard language for the political sphere and websites.
- Useful guiding language in the test itself, such as "continue" and "confirm".
- Should consider changing the *Home* Page to the *Test* page for clarity, and adding a different page for the 'About' section.

Control:
- Familiar user interface techniques, such as menu bars and *?* icons for help.
- Allows great ability to move between most pages in the website.

Consistency:
- Combination of *Page Name* at the top of the page, which is the same as the page name in the menu bar, allows understandable navigation.
- Every page beyond *Login* and *Sign up* have familiar, understandable layouts.
- The *Start Test* page has a bar on the bottom mentioning recent news stories that seems out of place. See minimalism.

Recognition:
- Constant menu bar allows users to move through the pages with ease.
- Great use of icons such as *?* and *User Image* to navigate.

Minimalism:
- Majority of design only contains necessary information and interfaces.
- The *Start Test* page has a "News" section at the bottom that seems out of place. It may make more sense if added to other sections of the quiz, such as policy or parties.

Help:
- Help option available at bottom of menu bar

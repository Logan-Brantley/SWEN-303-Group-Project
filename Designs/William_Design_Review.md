# William's Design Review
[William's A2 Designs](Designs/William_A2_Designs/SWEN_303_Report_2.pdf)<br>

Minimalism:
- Compact and clean job timetable layout.
- Easy to read mobile-formatted calendar.
- User reward points could be displayed larger and lower on the screen. They could include brief descriptions of reward below the title input area.
- Calendar pages might seem crowded on small devices.

Control:
- Rewards section has high utility for admin use (i.e. no limit caps).
- Swiping down on *My Jobs* page provides good accessibility to other pages.

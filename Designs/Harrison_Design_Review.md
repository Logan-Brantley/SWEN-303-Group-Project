- Desktop quiz pages are simple and clear, following common design paradigms for online quizzes (i.e. Myers Briggs quizzes).
- Desktop results page is clear and informative.
- Desktop about/info pages are cleaner than their mobile counterparts.
- Mobile about/info pages are cluttered.
- Mobile quiz page is less concise than desktop version.
- Mobile results page is more cluttered than its desktop counterpart.

Consistency:
- Home page utilises the colours of Elections NZ, but not the rest of the pages.

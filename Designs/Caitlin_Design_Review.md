# Caitlin's Design Review
[Caitlin's A2 Designs](Designs/Caitlin_A2_Design/CaitlinDesign.pdf)<br>

Control:
- Survey page makes the quiz easy to understand how to answer questions.
- Probably don't need a third tab for the survey on the survey results page if the 'Your Answers' tab shows the quiz anyways.

Consistency:
- All pages have same core layout (tabs at the top with content in the middle for most of the screen).
- Colour used in home page prototype does not utilise the same colours as Elections NZ.

Minimalism:
- Home page layout is simple and easy to understand.
- Survey results page lays out results clearly and concise.
- Political parties/electorate/policy pages lay out info cleanly and concise.
- Party policy page is an excellent way to link a specific party to their opinions on each policy.
- Specific policy page is an excellent way to show all parties' opinions on a specific policy.
- About page is a clean way to provide information about the software quiz.
- Electorate information page is a clean way to provide information about each candidate for a specific electorate.
- Party information page is a clean way to provide information about a party and link to their policies.
- No use of colour for any pages to highlight specific information.
- Survey page could have questions have a gap in between to further distinguish different questions.
- Political parties page could have the name and logo for each party in a column, the leader in a 2nd column, and then the link to the party's website in a 3rd column.
- Same critique as political parties for electorate page.
- Same critique as political parties for policy page.
- Election information may not need its own page (could be incorporated elsewhere - i.e. homepage).

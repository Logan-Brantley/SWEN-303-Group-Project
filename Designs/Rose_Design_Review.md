[Rose' A2 Designs](Designs/Rose_Design/SWEN303_assignment2_design.pdf)<br>

Minimalism:
- Flow between log in pages is well designed and leads user to common point of home screen.
- Good linear navigation from starting quiz to getting results.
- Good simple statistics page.
- Large amounts of text could be removed from the information pages by providing links to the appropriate websites (i.e. to a party's official site).

Control:
- Easy flow to and from central homepage.

Consistency:
- Consistent use of colour and style.
